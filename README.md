## Introduction
K-nearest neighbors algorithm implemented from scratch in Python, tested on iris dataset.

This dataset consists of samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (measured in cm). 
It was originally introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

## Methods used
* Reading data from csv using pandas
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn: pairplot, boxplot, violinplot

* Plotting algorithm's accuracy by different values of k using matplotlib

## Technologies used
* Python 3.8.8
* Pandas 1.2.4
* Numpy 1.20.1
* Matplotlib 3.3.4
* Seaborn 0.11.1
